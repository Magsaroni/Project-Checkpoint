<h2>And why you should play it.</h2> 
<h3>Splatoon is Nintendo's go at a 3rd person shooter game. The game was created by Hisashi Nogami. It is unique due to the fact that
    the player/characters are inspired off of squids and octopi. But, it is also unique due to the fact that this is Nintendo's FIRST 3rd person shooter.

<h4>
    DEVELOPMENT
</h4>
<h5>
    The first Splatoon game released in May 28th, 2015. The game was released for the Wii U (which did not sell too well.), but surprisingly,
    Splatoon sold exponentially well. The game first started it's development in late 2013. When being developed, the game originally started as these blocks. Though, Hisashi Nogami (the creator of Splatoon & Animal Crossing)
    stated that they were pieces of tofu. So, in its origins, the game was supposed to be a game about these blocks of tofu painting eachother and the ground with ink.
    Funny enough, there are clips online of some gameplay of this shown. I believe it was apart of an interview Hisashi Nogami was apart of.
    With time howeveer, the team decided to discuss. They didn't feel that tofu would fit this. Tofu? Shooting ink? What piece of tofu does that?
    They played around with ideas, and the one they seemed to like were bunnies. They made concept ideas of this. Bunnies that stood on their hind legs,
    wearing clothing and shoes, and of course, still shooting weapons filled with ink. But this STILL didn't make sense to Nogami. So the team pondered and thought.
    What animal would fit with shooting ink? Then they had the answer. Squids and Octopi. Originally, they tried to make them look more squid-like in a cartoonish way. But with more thought being put into it,
    they turned into this humanoid look. But, the catch is that they can still look like their squid or octopi selves. Their hair is replaced by their tentacles. In the first game, you only had one style for both male and female.
    Females had long hair with bangs, and the males had a topknot style. What I find personally clever is that they still managed to keep all ten limbs of the squid too. Their two arms and two legs, their hair, and if I am correct, their ears count as well.
    Even with the octopi, they kept all eight of their limbs as well. I still find it very neat. But, not only did the game add octopi and squids, they added other sea creatures as well.
    They added cuttlefish, shrimp, sea anemones, urchins, and more. There are no furballs to be seen in sight. Except for ONE creature...
